   - ✅ File modification indicators (asterisk for unsaved changes)
   - ✅ Save/Save As functionality with proper state management
   - ✅ Error banners and user feedback
   - ✅ Browser warning for unsaved changes on page close

### Phase 3: Study System

## Technical Decisions Made

### State Management Strategy
- **App-level state**: Current set, flashcard, edit mode, study session
- **Canvas state**: Zoom, pan, selections, tool state
- **Local state**: Component-specific UI state

### Canvas Implementation Approach
- HTML5 Canvas for performance with complex graphics
- Tool-based interaction model (select → click workflow)
- Coordinate transformation for zoom/pan
- Grid snapping with optional toggle

### File Format Strategy
- JSON for human-readable, version-controllable files
- Separate file types for sets vs templates
- Metadata embedded in files for validation

### Study Algorithm Design
- Pluggable algorithm system (SM-2 as default)
- Arrow-based testing (not card-based)
- Fuzzy matching for answer validation
- Configurable difficulty calculation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Strict TypeScript interfaces for all data
- React functional components with hooks
- Centralized state management
- Utility functions for reusable logic

### Testing Strategy (Future)
- Unit tests for algorithms and utilities
- Integration tests for file operations
- E2E tests for critical user workflows

### Performance Considerations
- Canvas rendering optimization
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Efficient arrow collision detection
- Memory management for large flashcard sets

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- File operations not yet implemented (need Tauri APIs)
- Canvas drawing is placeholder implementation
- No media support (text-only initially)
- No real-time collaboration

### Planned Enhancements
- Rich text formatting support
- Image/audio/video integration
- Advanced search and filtering
- Cross-flashcard relationships
- Export to various formats (PDF, Anki, etc.)

## Getting Started with Development

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete the FlashcardCanvas implementation
2. Add CSS styling for all components
3. Implement Tauri file operations
4. Create sample flashcard sets for testing
5. Add basic error handling throughout

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run tauri:dev    # Start Tauri development
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run tauri:build  # Build Tauri app
```

This framework provides a solid foundation for implementing all features specified in the project requirements while maintaining code quality and extensibility.
