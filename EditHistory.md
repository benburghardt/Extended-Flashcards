# Edit History - Extended Flashcards Project

This document tracks all changes made to the Extended Flashcards project, including errors encountered and their resolutions.

## Session 1: Initial Project Setup (September 16, 2025)

### Overview
Initial setup of the Extended Flashcards project using Tauri (Rust backend) and React + Vite (frontend) to create a native desktop application for multi-sided flashcards with labeled relationships.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Tauri Backend Initialization
- **Action**: Initialized Tauri project structure using `cargo tauri init`
- **Files Created**:
  - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Rust package configuration
  - `src-tauri/build.rs` - Build script
  - `src-tauri/src/` - Rust source directory
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/` - Tauri capabilities configuration
  - `src-tauri/icons/` - Application icons
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri configuration
  - `src-tauri/.gitignore` - Git ignore for Rust artifacts

- **Configuration Used**:
  ```bash
  cargo tauri init --app-name "extended-flashcards" --window-title "Extended Flashcards" --frontend-dist "../dist" --dev-url "http://localhost:5173" --before-dev-command "npm run dev" --before-build-command "npm run build" --force
  ```

#### 2. Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- **Action**: Set up modern React development environment
- **Commands Executed**:
  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react react react-dom typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
  ```

- **Files Created**:
  - `package.json` - Node.js package configuration with dependencies
  - `vite.config.ts` - Vite build tool configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for the main project
  - `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration for Node.js files
  - `index.html` - Main HTML entry point
  - `src/main.tsx` - React application entry point
  - `src/App.tsx` - Main React component
  - `src/App.css` - Application-level styling
  - `src/index.css` - Global styling

#### 3. Build Scripts Configuration
- **Action**: Updated package.json with comprehensive build scripts
- **Scripts Added**:
  ```json
  {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "tauri:dev": "cargo tauri dev",
    "tauri:build": "cargo tauri build"
  }
  ```

### Errors Encountered and Resolutions

#### Error 1: Tauri CLI Command Not Found
- **Error**: `/usr/bin/bash: line 1: tauri: command not found`
- **Root Cause**: Attempted to use `tauri` command directly instead of `cargo tauri`
- **Resolution**: Used `cargo tauri --version` to verify CLI installation, then used `cargo tauri init` instead
- **Learning**: Tauri CLI is accessed through Cargo, not as a standalone command

#### Error 2: Incorrect Tauri Init Parameters
- **Error**: `error: unexpected argument '--dist-dir' found`
- **Root Cause**: Used incorrect parameter names from older Tauri version documentation
- **Resolution**: Used `cargo tauri init --help` to check correct parameter names, updated to use `--frontend-dist` instead of `--dist-dir`
- **Learning**: Always check current CLI help before using commands, parameter names change between versions

#### Error 3: React Import Error in TypeScript
- **Error**: `error TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read`
- **Root Cause**: React 19 uses automatic JSX transform, making explicit React imports unnecessary
- **Resolution**: Removed `import React from 'react'` from App.tsx, keeping only the CSS import
- **Learning**: Modern React with new JSX transform doesn't require explicit React imports in JSX files

#### Error 4: Tauri Plugin Version Format
- **Error**: `Failed to parse version '2.0' for crate 'tauri-plugin-log'`
- **Root Cause**: Cargo expects more specific version format for dependencies
- **Resolution**: Changed `tauri-plugin-log = "2.0"` to more specific version (though compilation still showed warnings)
- **Learning**: Use specific version numbers for Cargo dependencies to avoid parsing issues

### Technical Decisions Made

#### 1. Frontend Framework Choice

## Session 3: Core Implementation & Arrow System Refinement (September 17-18, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented the complete Phase 1 core functionality including canvas rendering, interactive editing, comprehensive styling, and an advanced arrow pathing system. Transformed the project from a technical framework into a fully functional flashcard editing application with professional-grade user interactions.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Complete Canvas Rendering System Implementation
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Major Changes**:
  - Implemented full HTML5 Canvas rendering with device pixel ratio scaling
  - Added comprehensive mouse interaction handling (click, drag, double-click, wheel)
  - Created tool-based workflow system (select, add-side, add-arrow, pan)
  - Implemented zoom and pan functionality with proper coordinate transformations
  - Added inline text editing for both sides and arrows
  - Created visual feedback systems (hover effects, selection highlighting, previews)

- **Technical Implementation Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Key rendering pipeline established
  const resizeCanvas = useCallback(() => {
    canvas.width = rect.width * window.devicePixelRatio;
    canvas.height = rect.height * window.devicePixelRatio;
    ctx.scale(window.devicePixelRatio, window.devicePixelRatio);
  }, []);

  // Comprehensive coordinate transformation system
  const getCanvasPosition = useCallback((event: MouseEvent): Position => {
    const canvasX = (screenX - canvasState.panOffset.x) / canvasState.zoom;
    const canvasY = (screenY - canvasState.panOffset.y) / canvasState.zoom;
    return { x: canvasX, y: canvasY };
  }, [canvasState]);
  ```

- **User Interaction Features**:
  - **Drag and Drop**: Full side repositioning with grid snapping
  - **Text Editing**: Double-click to edit sides, automatic arrow text editing
  - **Tool Switching**: Seamless transitions between select, add-side, add-arrow, and pan tools
  - **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, selection highlighting, and placement previews
  - **Multi-interaction**: Right-click panning, wheel zooming, keyboard shortcuts

#### 2. Advanced Arrow Pathing System
- **File**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts`
- **Revolutionary Implementation**: Complete redesign of arrow routing logic based on professional diagram software standards

- **Vector-Based Edge Detection**:
  ```typescript
  static determineEdgeFromVector(fromSide: FlashcardSide, toSide: FlashcardSide): 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' {
    // Calculate intersection points with each edge using vector math
    const dx = toCenter.x - fromCenter.x;
    const dy = toCenter.y - fromCenter.y;

    // Find edge with shortest distance where vector intersects
    // Returns the most logical edge for arrow exit/entry
  }
  ```

- **Intelligent Arrow Distribution**:
  - **Horizontal Edges (top/bottom)**: Sort by largest X coordinate, then lowest Y difference
  - **Vertical Edges (left/right)**: Sort by largest Y coordinate, then lowest X difference
  - **Edge Placement**: Distribute arrows across middle 80% of each edge
  - **Directional Logic**:
    - Top edge: left-to-right placement
    - Bottom edge: right-to-left placement
    - Left edge: top-to-bottom placement
    - Right edge: bottom-to-top placement

- **Professional Path Generation**:
  ```typescript
  static calculateArrowPathWithTravel(sourcePoint, destPoint, sourceEdge, destEdge): Position[] {
    // Minimum travel: 20% of total distance or 40px (whichever larger)
    const minTravel = Math.max(distance * 0.2, 40);

    // Create 4-point perpendicular paths with proper travel distances
    return [sourcePoint, firstCorner, secondCorner, destPoint];
  }
  ```

  /* Dynamic tool-based cursor system */
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-select { cursor: default; }
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-pan { cursor: grab; }
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-pan:active,
  .flashcard-canvas.panning { cursor: grabbing; }

  /* Responsive sizing with clamp functions */
  .tool-button {
    width: clamp(32px, 6vw, 48px);
    height: clamp(32px, 6vw, 48px);
    font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2.5vw, 1.4rem);
  }
  ```

    updateCurrentFlashcard({ ...currentFlashcard, arrows: [...arrows, newArrow] });
    setNewArrowForEditing(newArrow.id); // Trigger immediate text editing
  };

  // Comprehensive selection management
  const handleArrowSelect = (arrowId: string, multiSelect?: boolean) => {
    if (multiSelect && selectedArrowIds.includes(arrowId)) {
      // Remove from selection
    } else if (multiSelect) {
      // Add to selection
    } else {
      // Single selection
    }

## Session 4: Canvas Interaction Refinements & Arrow Distribution Overhaul (September 19, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented three critical user experience improvements to finalize Phase 1 development: centered side placement, improved drag behavior with offset preservation, and a complete redesign of the arrow distribution system to properly handle mixed inbound/outbound arrows on shared edges.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Centered Side Placement Tool
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Problem Addressed**: Side placement tool positioned cursor at top-left corner of new sides instead of centering
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated preview rendering to center preview on cursor position by offsetting by half the side dimensions
  - Modified actual side creation logic to place sides centered on click position
  - Applied centering to both grid-snapped and free placement modes

- **Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // Preview positioning - lines 308-312
  const centeredCanvasPos = {
    x: canvasMousePos.x - SIDE_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvasMousePos.y - SIDE_HEIGHT / 2
  };

  // Actual placement - lines 458-466
  const centeredPos = {
    x: canvasPos.x - SIDE_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvasPos.y - SIDE_HEIGHT / 2
  };
  ```

#### 2. Enhanced Drag Behavior with Offset Preservation
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Problem Addressed**: Sides would snap to cursor position when dragging instead of maintaining relative offset from click point
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `dragOffset` state to track click position relative to side's top-left corner
  - Modified drag behavior to maintain this offset throughout the drag operation
  - Enhanced user experience by allowing precise positioning regardless of where user grabs the side

- **Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // Added state tracking - line 57
  const [dragOffset, setDragOffset] = useState<Position | null>(null);

  // Calculate offset on mouse down - lines 522-527
  const clickOffset = {
    x: canvasPos.x - clickedSide.position.x,
    y: canvasPos.y - clickedSide.position.y
  };
  setDragOffset(clickOffset);

  // Use offset during drag - lines 560-564
  const newPosition = {
    x: canvasPos.x - dragOffset.x,
    y: canvasPos.y - dragOffset.y
  };
  ```

#### 3. Complete Arrow Distribution System Redesign
- **File Modified**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts`
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrow distribution system had fundamental architectural flaw where inbound and outbound arrows were calculated separately, causing poor edge distribution
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Previous system calculated arrow positions from arrow perspective rather than side perspective, leading to:
  - Inbound arrows clustering at fixed offset positions
  - Outbound arrows not shifting when inbound arrows were added
  - Inconsistent edge utilization across side boundaries

- **Architectural Solution**: Complete redesign to side-centric approach
  - **Before**: Arrow asked "where should I position myself on source/destination?"
  - **After**: Arrow asks each side "where on your edge should I connect?"

#### 3.1 New Side-Centric Connection Point System
- **Function Added**: `getSideEdgeConnectionPoint()` - Central function for all edge connection logic
- **Design Philosophy**: Each side manages its own edge connections and provides connection points when requested
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Arrow determines which edges to connect to using existing vector logic
  2. Arrow requests connection point from source side for source edge
  3. Arrow requests connection point from destination side for destination edge
  4. Each side independently calculates optimal position based on ALL its edge connections

#### 3.2 Mixed Inbound/Outbound Arrow Collection
- **Implementation**: Single collection per edge containing both arrow directions
- **Collection Logic**:
  ```typescript
  // Outbound from this side
  if (sourceSide.id === side.id) {
    return this.determineEdgeFromVector(sourceSide, destSide) === edge;
  }

  // Inbound to this side - Key fix!
  if (destSide.id === side.id) {
    return this.determineEdgeFromVector(destSide, sourceSide) === edge;
  }
  ```

- **Critical Fix**: For inbound arrows, use `determineEdgeFromVector(destSide, sourceSide)` instead of `determineEdgeFromVector(sourceSide, destSide)` to correctly identify destination edge

#### 3.3 Unified Sorting Algorithm
- **Sorting Criteria**: All arrows on an edge sorted by position of their "other end" (connected side)
- **Mixed Direction Handling**: Inbound and outbound arrows intermixed based on spatial relationships, not grouped by direction
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same sorting logic applied regardless of arrow direction

#### 3.4 Legacy Code Removal
- **Removed Function**: `sortArrowsForEdge()` - No longer needed with new architecture
- **Simplified Logic**: Eliminated complex separation of inbound/outbound arrays and index calculations
- **Reduced Complexity**: From ~70 lines of complex logic to ~25 lines of clear, understandable code

### Technical Benefits Achieved

#### 1. User Experience Improvements
- **Intuitive Side Placement**: Sides now appear exactly where user expects them (centered on cursor)
- **Natural Drag Behavior**: Maintains hand position relative to side during dragging
- **Professional Arrow Distribution**: Inbound and outbound arrows evenly distributed across shared edges

#### 2. System Architecture Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each side manages its own edge connections independently
- **Scalability**: New system handles complex arrow networks with multiple directions naturally
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for edge connection logic

#### 3. Bug Resolutions
- **Edge Distribution**: Fixed inbound arrows clustering at offset positions
- **Dynamic Redistribution**: Outbound arrows now properly shift when inbound arrows are added
- **Spatial Consistency**: All arrows on shared edges use consistent positioning logic

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines of Code Reduced**: Arrow distribution logic decreased from ~70 to ~25 lines
- **Complexity Reduction**: Eliminated nested conditional logic and array management
- **Function Clarity**: Single-purpose functions with clear responsibilities
- **Bug Surface Area**: Reduced potential for edge cases through unified logic path

### Testing and Validation
- **Visual Validation**: Confirmed proper arrow distribution across all edge types
- **Interaction Testing**: Verified drag behavior maintains expected offset relationships
- **Placement Accuracy**: Validated side placement centers correctly on cursor
- **Mixed Arrow Scenarios**: Tested complex cases with multiple inbound/outbound arrows on same edges

  - Source arrows (where current side is source) sort after destination arrows (where current side is destination)
  - Applied to both horizontal and vertical edges with 5px tolerance for position matching
  - Provides consistent, predictable arrow distribution for bidirectional relationships

#### 2. Advanced Arrow Hover Highlighting System
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx` (lines 59, 168-175, 219-223, 560-567)
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrows had no visual feedback when hovered, making interaction unclear
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `hoverArrowId` state tracking for arrow hover detection
  - Enhanced arrow rendering with multiple visual states:
    - **Selected**: Blue (#3498db) with 3px line width
    - **Hovered**: Light blue (#74b9ff) with 2.5px line width

  - Enhanced label styling with hover effects (lighter background, blue border)
  - Integrated with mouse move handler to detect arrow proximity (15px tolerance)
  - Updated dependency arrays to ensure proper re-rendering

#### 3. Comprehensive Collision Detection for Arrow Middle Segments
- **File Modified**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts` (lines 486-690)
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrow middle segments could pass through sides and other arrows, creating visual clutter
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Line-Rectangle Intersection**: `lineIntersectsRectangle()` for detecting arrow-side collisions
  - **Line-Line Intersection**: `lineSegmentsIntersect()` for detecting arrow-arrow collisions
  - **Collision Detection**: `checkMiddleSegmentCollisions()` checks 4-point arrow paths against all elements
  - **Path Adjustment**: `adjustPathForCollisions()` attempts multiple travel distances to avoid collisions
  - **Progressive Resolution**: Tries larger travel distances in both directions before fallback
  - **Recursion Prevention**: Added `skipCollisionDetection` parameter to prevent infinite loops
- **Integration**: Modified `calculateAdvancedArrowPath()` to use collision avoidance automatically

#### 4. Recursion Bug Fix in Collision Detection
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts` (lines 53, 224, 566)
- **Problem Identified**: Maximum call stack exceeded when adding second arrow
- **Root Cause**: Infinite recursion loop where Arrow A checking Arrow B caused Arrow B to check Arrow A
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added optional `skipCollisionDetection` parameter to `calculateAdvancedArrowPath()`
  - Updated recursive calls to pass `true` for collision detection to prevent further collision checking
  - Fixed `isPointNearArrow()` to skip collision detection for performance and recursion prevention
  - Maintained collision avoidance functionality while preventing stack overflow

#### 5. Dynamic Text Input Scaling with Zoom
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx` (lines 458-504, 401-403, 432-433, 647-650, 670-672, 759, 795)
- **Problem Addressed**: Text input boxes didn't scale with zoom level, becoming misaligned and improperly sized

  const webFileAPI = {
    async open() {
      return new Promise<{ name: string; content: string }>((resolve, reject) => {
        const input = document.createElement('input');
        input.type = 'file';
        input.accept = '.json';
        // Complete file reader implementation...
      });
    },
    async save(filename: string, content: string) {
      const blob = new Blob([content], { type: 'application/json' });
      // Browser download implementation...

#### 5. Invoke Error Elimination Strategy
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/services/TauriFileService.ts`
  - `src/components/FileManager/FileManager.tsx`
  - `src/utils/environmentDetection.ts`
- **Problem Addressed**: Web version showed 'invoke' errors from failed Tauri API access
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Environment Pre-Detection**: Check environment before attempting Tauri imports
  - **Cached Detection Results**: Avoid repeated dynamic import attempts
  - **Recent Files Filtering**: Hide recent files in web environments to prevent non-functional interactions
  - **Clean Error Handling**: Proper fallback without console pollution

### Technical Architecture Improvements

#### 1. Centralized Environment Detection System
- **Design Philosophy**: Single source of truth for environment detection across the application
- **Caching Strategy**: One-time detection with cached results for performance
- **API Provided**:
  ```typescript
  export const detectEnvironment = async (): Promise<'desktop' | 'web'>;
  export const isDesktop = async (): Promise<boolean>;
  export const isWeb = async (): Promise<boolean>;
  export const getEnvironmentSync = (): 'desktop' | 'web' | null;
  ```

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and User Experience
- **File Operations**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Web Limitations**: Clear communication when desktop-only features are accessed
- **Graceful Degradation**: Web version maintains core functionality with appropriate UI adjustments
- **Error Prevention**: Recent files hidden in web to prevent unsuccessful operations

#### 3. Type Safety and Code Quality
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All new code follows strict TypeScript patterns
- **Interface Consistency**: Maintained existing interfaces while adding null support where needed
- **Clean Import Structure**: Organized imports with clear separation of desktop vs web utilities

### User Experience Enhancements

#### 1. Cross-Platform File Operations
- **Desktop Experience**: Full native file system access with recent files and path-based operations
- **Web Experience**: Browser-based file dialogs with download-based saving
- **Consistent Interface**: Same UI components work seamlessly across both environments
- **Error Clarity**: Clear feedback when features aren't available in specific environments

#### 2. Improved File Loading Workflow
- **Content Clearing**: Canvas properly clears when opening new files
- **Visual Feedback**: File name consistently displays in top-right header
- **State Management**: Proper flashcard selection when opening files with existing content
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced API Calls**: Environment detection cached to prevent repeated dynamic imports
- **Selective UI Rendering**: Recent files only shown when functional
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of file readers and blob URLs in web version

### Validation and Testing Results

#### Before Implementation
- ❌ Web version showed 'invoke' errors and couldn't access files
- ❌ File loading didn't clear canvas or display content properly
- ❌ File name disappeared when File Manager was opened
- ❌ Recent files caused errors in web version

#### After Implementation
- ✅ Web version works without errors using browser File API
- ✅ File loading properly clears canvas and displays loaded content
- ✅ File name persists consistently in top-right display
- ✅ Recent files hidden appropriately in web version
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
