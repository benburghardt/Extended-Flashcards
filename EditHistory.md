# Edit History - Extended Flashcards Project

This document tracks all changes made to the Extended Flashcards project, including errors encountered and their resolutions.

## Session 1: Initial Project Setup (September 16, 2025)

### Overview
Initial setup of the Extended Flashcards project using Tauri (Rust backend) and React + Vite (frontend) to create a native desktop application for multi-sided flashcards with labeled relationships.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Tauri Backend Initialization
- **Action**: Initialized Tauri project structure using `cargo tauri init`
- **Files Created**:
  - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Rust package configuration
  - `src-tauri/build.rs` - Build script
  - `src-tauri/src/` - Rust source directory
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/` - Tauri capabilities configuration
  - `src-tauri/icons/` - Application icons
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri configuration
  - `src-tauri/.gitignore` - Git ignore for Rust artifacts

- **Configuration Used**:
  ```bash
  cargo tauri init --app-name "extended-flashcards" --window-title "Extended Flashcards" --frontend-dist "../dist" --dev-url "http://localhost:5173" --before-dev-command "npm run dev" --before-build-command "npm run build" --force
  ```

#### 2. Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- **Action**: Set up modern React development environment
- **Commands Executed**:
  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react react react-dom typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
  ```

- **Files Created**:
  - `package.json` - Node.js package configuration with dependencies
  - `vite.config.ts` - Vite build tool configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for the main project
  - `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration for Node.js files
  - `index.html` - Main HTML entry point
  - `src/main.tsx` - React application entry point
  - `src/App.tsx` - Main React component
  - `src/App.css` - Application-level styling
  - `src/index.css` - Global styling

#### 3. Build Scripts Configuration
- **Action**: Updated package.json with comprehensive build scripts
- **Scripts Added**:
  ```json
  {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "tauri:dev": "cargo tauri dev",
    "tauri:build": "cargo tauri build"
  }
  ```

### Errors Encountered and Resolutions

#### Error 1: Tauri CLI Command Not Found
- **Error**: `/usr/bin/bash: line 1: tauri: command not found`
- **Root Cause**: Attempted to use `tauri` command directly instead of `cargo tauri`
- **Resolution**: Used `cargo tauri --version` to verify CLI installation, then used `cargo tauri init` instead
- **Learning**: Tauri CLI is accessed through Cargo, not as a standalone command

#### Error 2: Incorrect Tauri Init Parameters
- **Error**: `error: unexpected argument '--dist-dir' found`
- **Root Cause**: Used incorrect parameter names from older Tauri version documentation
- **Resolution**: Used `cargo tauri init --help` to check correct parameter names, updated to use `--frontend-dist` instead of `--dist-dir`
- **Learning**: Always check current CLI help before using commands, parameter names change between versions

#### Error 3: React Import Error in TypeScript
- **Error**: `error TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read`
- **Root Cause**: React 19 uses automatic JSX transform, making explicit React imports unnecessary
- **Resolution**: Removed `import React from 'react'` from App.tsx, keeping only the CSS import
- **Learning**: Modern React with new JSX transform doesn't require explicit React imports in JSX files

#### Error 4: Tauri Plugin Version Format
- **Error**: `Failed to parse version '2.0' for crate 'tauri-plugin-log'`
- **Root Cause**: Cargo expects more specific version format for dependencies
- **Resolution**: Changed `tauri-plugin-log = "2.0"` to more specific version (though compilation still showed warnings)
- **Learning**: Use specific version numbers for Cargo dependencies to avoid parsing issues

### Technical Decisions Made

#### 1. Frontend Framework Choice

## Session 3: Core Implementation & Arrow System Refinement (September 17-18, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented the complete Phase 1 core functionality including canvas rendering, interactive editing, comprehensive styling, and an advanced arrow pathing system. Transformed the project from a technical framework into a fully functional flashcard editing application with professional-grade user interactions.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Complete Canvas Rendering System Implementation
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Major Changes**:
  - Implemented full HTML5 Canvas rendering with device pixel ratio scaling
  - Added comprehensive mouse interaction handling (click, drag, double-click, wheel)
  - Created tool-based workflow system (select, add-side, add-arrow, pan)
  - Implemented zoom and pan functionality with proper coordinate transformations
  - Added inline text editing for both sides and arrows
  - Created visual feedback systems (hover effects, selection highlighting, previews)

- **Technical Implementation Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Key rendering pipeline established
  const resizeCanvas = useCallback(() => {
    canvas.width = rect.width * window.devicePixelRatio;
    canvas.height = rect.height * window.devicePixelRatio;
    ctx.scale(window.devicePixelRatio, window.devicePixelRatio);
  }, []);

  // Comprehensive coordinate transformation system
  const getCanvasPosition = useCallback((event: MouseEvent): Position => {
    const canvasX = (screenX - canvasState.panOffset.x) / canvasState.zoom;
    const canvasY = (screenY - canvasState.panOffset.y) / canvasState.zoom;
    return { x: canvasX, y: canvasY };
  }, [canvasState]);
  ```

- **User Interaction Features**:
  - **Drag and Drop**: Full side repositioning with grid snapping
  - **Text Editing**: Double-click to edit sides, automatic arrow text editing
  - **Tool Switching**: Seamless transitions between select, add-side, add-arrow, and pan tools
  - **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, selection highlighting, and placement previews
  - **Multi-interaction**: Right-click panning, wheel zooming, keyboard shortcuts

#### 2. Advanced Arrow Pathing System
- **File**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts`
- **Revolutionary Implementation**: Complete redesign of arrow routing logic based on professional diagram software standards

- **Vector-Based Edge Detection**:
  ```typescript
  static determineEdgeFromVector(fromSide: FlashcardSide, toSide: FlashcardSide): 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' {
    // Calculate intersection points with each edge using vector math
    const dx = toCenter.x - fromCenter.x;
    const dy = toCenter.y - fromCenter.y;

    // Find edge with shortest distance where vector intersects
    // Returns the most logical edge for arrow exit/entry
  }
  ```

- **Intelligent Arrow Distribution**:
  - **Horizontal Edges (top/bottom)**: Sort by largest X coordinate, then lowest Y difference
  - **Vertical Edges (left/right)**: Sort by largest Y coordinate, then lowest X difference
  - **Edge Placement**: Distribute arrows across middle 80% of each edge
  - **Directional Logic**:
    - Top edge: left-to-right placement
    - Bottom edge: right-to-left placement
    - Left edge: top-to-bottom placement
    - Right edge: bottom-to-top placement

- **Professional Path Generation**:
  ```typescript
  static calculateArrowPathWithTravel(sourcePoint, destPoint, sourceEdge, destEdge): Position[] {
    // Minimum travel: 20% of total distance or 40px (whichever larger)
    const minTravel = Math.max(distance * 0.2, 40);

    // Create 4-point perpendicular paths with proper travel distances
    return [sourcePoint, firstCorner, secondCorner, destPoint];
  }
  ```

  /* Dynamic tool-based cursor system */
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-select { cursor: default; }
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-pan { cursor: grab; }
  .flashcard-canvas.tool-pan:active,
  .flashcard-canvas.panning { cursor: grabbing; }

  /* Responsive sizing with clamp functions */
  .tool-button {
    width: clamp(32px, 6vw, 48px);
    height: clamp(32px, 6vw, 48px);
    font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2.5vw, 1.4rem);
  }
  ```

    updateCurrentFlashcard({ ...currentFlashcard, arrows: [...arrows, newArrow] });
    setNewArrowForEditing(newArrow.id); // Trigger immediate text editing
  };

  // Comprehensive selection management
  const handleArrowSelect = (arrowId: string, multiSelect?: boolean) => {
    if (multiSelect && selectedArrowIds.includes(arrowId)) {
      // Remove from selection
    } else if (multiSelect) {
      // Add to selection
    } else {
      // Single selection
    }

## Session 4: Canvas Interaction Refinements & Arrow Distribution Overhaul (September 19, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented three critical user experience improvements to finalize Phase 1 development: centered side placement, improved drag behavior with offset preservation, and a complete redesign of the arrow distribution system to properly handle mixed inbound/outbound arrows on shared edges.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Centered Side Placement Tool
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Problem Addressed**: Side placement tool positioned cursor at top-left corner of new sides instead of centering
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated preview rendering to center preview on cursor position by offsetting by half the side dimensions
  - Modified actual side creation logic to place sides centered on click position
  - Applied centering to both grid-snapped and free placement modes

- **Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // Preview positioning - lines 308-312
  const centeredCanvasPos = {
    x: canvasMousePos.x - SIDE_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvasMousePos.y - SIDE_HEIGHT / 2
  };

  // Actual placement - lines 458-466
  const centeredPos = {
    x: canvasPos.x - SIDE_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvasPos.y - SIDE_HEIGHT / 2
  };
  ```

#### 2. Enhanced Drag Behavior with Offset Preservation
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx`
- **Problem Addressed**: Sides would snap to cursor position when dragging instead of maintaining relative offset from click point
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `dragOffset` state to track click position relative to side's top-left corner
  - Modified drag behavior to maintain this offset throughout the drag operation
  - Enhanced user experience by allowing precise positioning regardless of where user grabs the side

- **Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // Added state tracking - line 57
  const [dragOffset, setDragOffset] = useState<Position | null>(null);

  // Calculate offset on mouse down - lines 522-527
  const clickOffset = {
    x: canvasPos.x - clickedSide.position.x,
    y: canvasPos.y - clickedSide.position.y
  };
  setDragOffset(clickOffset);

  // Use offset during drag - lines 560-564
  const newPosition = {
    x: canvasPos.x - dragOffset.x,
    y: canvasPos.y - dragOffset.y
  };
  ```

#### 3. Complete Arrow Distribution System Redesign
- **File Modified**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts`
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrow distribution system had fundamental architectural flaw where inbound and outbound arrows were calculated separately, causing poor edge distribution
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Previous system calculated arrow positions from arrow perspective rather than side perspective, leading to:
  - Inbound arrows clustering at fixed offset positions
  - Outbound arrows not shifting when inbound arrows were added
  - Inconsistent edge utilization across side boundaries

- **Architectural Solution**: Complete redesign to side-centric approach
  - **Before**: Arrow asked "where should I position myself on source/destination?"
  - **After**: Arrow asks each side "where on your edge should I connect?"

#### 3.1 New Side-Centric Connection Point System
- **Function Added**: `getSideEdgeConnectionPoint()` - Central function for all edge connection logic
- **Design Philosophy**: Each side manages its own edge connections and provides connection points when requested
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Arrow determines which edges to connect to using existing vector logic
  2. Arrow requests connection point from source side for source edge
  3. Arrow requests connection point from destination side for destination edge
  4. Each side independently calculates optimal position based on ALL its edge connections

#### 3.2 Mixed Inbound/Outbound Arrow Collection
- **Implementation**: Single collection per edge containing both arrow directions
- **Collection Logic**:
  ```typescript
  // Outbound from this side
  if (sourceSide.id === side.id) {
    return this.determineEdgeFromVector(sourceSide, destSide) === edge;
  }

  // Inbound to this side - Key fix!
  if (destSide.id === side.id) {
    return this.determineEdgeFromVector(destSide, sourceSide) === edge;
  }
  ```

- **Critical Fix**: For inbound arrows, use `determineEdgeFromVector(destSide, sourceSide)` instead of `determineEdgeFromVector(sourceSide, destSide)` to correctly identify destination edge

#### 3.3 Unified Sorting Algorithm
- **Sorting Criteria**: All arrows on an edge sorted by position of their "other end" (connected side)
- **Mixed Direction Handling**: Inbound and outbound arrows intermixed based on spatial relationships, not grouped by direction
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same sorting logic applied regardless of arrow direction

#### 3.4 Legacy Code Removal
- **Removed Function**: `sortArrowsForEdge()` - No longer needed with new architecture
- **Simplified Logic**: Eliminated complex separation of inbound/outbound arrays and index calculations
- **Reduced Complexity**: From ~70 lines of complex logic to ~25 lines of clear, understandable code

### Technical Benefits Achieved

#### 1. User Experience Improvements
- **Intuitive Side Placement**: Sides now appear exactly where user expects them (centered on cursor)
- **Natural Drag Behavior**: Maintains hand position relative to side during dragging
- **Professional Arrow Distribution**: Inbound and outbound arrows evenly distributed across shared edges

#### 2. System Architecture Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each side manages its own edge connections independently
- **Scalability**: New system handles complex arrow networks with multiple directions naturally
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for edge connection logic

#### 3. Bug Resolutions
- **Edge Distribution**: Fixed inbound arrows clustering at offset positions
- **Dynamic Redistribution**: Outbound arrows now properly shift when inbound arrows are added
- **Spatial Consistency**: All arrows on shared edges use consistent positioning logic

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines of Code Reduced**: Arrow distribution logic decreased from ~70 to ~25 lines
- **Complexity Reduction**: Eliminated nested conditional logic and array management
- **Function Clarity**: Single-purpose functions with clear responsibilities
- **Bug Surface Area**: Reduced potential for edge cases through unified logic path

### Testing and Validation
- **Visual Validation**: Confirmed proper arrow distribution across all edge types
- **Interaction Testing**: Verified drag behavior maintains expected offset relationships
- **Placement Accuracy**: Validated side placement centers correctly on cursor
- **Mixed Arrow Scenarios**: Tested complex cases with multiple inbound/outbound arrows on same edges

  - Source arrows (where current side is source) sort after destination arrows (where current side is destination)
  - Applied to both horizontal and vertical edges with 5px tolerance for position matching
  - Provides consistent, predictable arrow distribution for bidirectional relationships

#### 2. Advanced Arrow Hover Highlighting System
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx` (lines 59, 168-175, 219-223, 560-567)
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrows had no visual feedback when hovered, making interaction unclear
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `hoverArrowId` state tracking for arrow hover detection
  - Enhanced arrow rendering with multiple visual states:
    - **Selected**: Blue (#3498db) with 3px line width
    - **Hovered**: Light blue (#74b9ff) with 2.5px line width

  - Enhanced label styling with hover effects (lighter background, blue border)
  - Integrated with mouse move handler to detect arrow proximity (15px tolerance)
  - Updated dependency arrays to ensure proper re-rendering

#### 3. Comprehensive Collision Detection for Arrow Middle Segments
- **File Modified**: `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts` (lines 486-690)
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrow middle segments could pass through sides and other arrows, creating visual clutter
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Line-Rectangle Intersection**: `lineIntersectsRectangle()` for detecting arrow-side collisions
  - **Line-Line Intersection**: `lineSegmentsIntersect()` for detecting arrow-arrow collisions
  - **Collision Detection**: `checkMiddleSegmentCollisions()` checks 4-point arrow paths against all elements
  - **Path Adjustment**: `adjustPathForCollisions()` attempts multiple travel distances to avoid collisions
  - **Progressive Resolution**: Tries larger travel distances in both directions before fallback
  - **Recursion Prevention**: Added `skipCollisionDetection` parameter to prevent infinite loops
- **Integration**: Modified `calculateAdvancedArrowPath()` to use collision avoidance automatically

#### 4. Recursion Bug Fix in Collision Detection
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts` (lines 53, 224, 566)
- **Problem Identified**: Maximum call stack exceeded when adding second arrow
- **Root Cause**: Infinite recursion loop where Arrow A checking Arrow B caused Arrow B to check Arrow A
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added optional `skipCollisionDetection` parameter to `calculateAdvancedArrowPath()`
  - Updated recursive calls to pass `true` for collision detection to prevent further collision checking
  - Fixed `isPointNearArrow()` to skip collision detection for performance and recursion prevention
  - Maintained collision avoidance functionality while preventing stack overflow

#### 5. Dynamic Text Input Scaling with Zoom
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Canvas/FlashcardCanvas.tsx` (lines 458-504, 401-403, 432-433, 647-650, 670-672, 759, 795)
- **Problem Addressed**: Text input boxes didn't scale with zoom level, becoming misaligned and improperly sized

  const webFileAPI = {
    async open() {
      return new Promise<{ name: string; content: string }>((resolve, reject) => {
        const input = document.createElement('input');
        input.type = 'file';
        input.accept = '.json';
        // Complete file reader implementation...
      });
    },
    async save(filename: string, content: string) {
      const blob = new Blob([content], { type: 'application/json' });
      // Browser download implementation...

## Session 9: Phase 3 Completion - Progress Persistence & Custom Path Overhaul (October 15, 2025)

### Overview
Completed Phase 3 with full progress persistence implementation, ready cards counter for spaced repetition, and a complete redesign of custom path mode into an interactive network browser. This session addressed three critical user-reported issues: progress files not saving, missing spaced repetition counter, and custom path UI requiring a complete overhaul for better usability.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Progress Persistence Service Implementation
- **File Created**: `src/services/ProgressService.ts` (281 lines)
- **Problem Addressed**: No progress tracking between study sessions, preventing spaced repetition from functioning properly
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Separate Progress Files**: Progress stored in `.progress.json` files alongside flashcard sets for easy sharing without progress data
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Desktop (Tauri file system) and web (localStorage) implementations
  - **SM-2 Integration**: Complete integration with spaced repetition algorithm for `nextReview` scheduling
  - **Immediate Saving**: Progress saved after each answer, not just at session end
  - **Validation System**: Comprehensive progress data structure validation

- **Key Technical Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Progress data structure
  export interface ProgressData {
    flashcardSetId: string;
    flashcardSetName: string;
    progress: Record<string, StudyProgress>;  // arrowId -> StudyProgress
    lastUpdated: Date;
    version: string;
  }

  // Desktop: .progress.json file alongside flashcard set
  // Example: flashcards.json -> flashcards.progress.json

  // Web: localStorage with set ID as key
  // Key: "extended-flashcards-progress-{flashcardSetId}"
  ```

- **Service Methods Provided**:
  - `loadProgress()`: Load existing progress for a flashcard set
  - `saveProgress()`: Save updated progress after study sessions
  - `getReadyCardsCount()`: Count arrows due for review
  - `getReadyArrows()`: Filter arrows ready to study
  - `clearProgress()`: Reset all progress for a set

#### 2. Windows Path Separator Fix
- **File Modified**: `src/services/ProgressService.ts` (lines 236-247)
- **Problem Addressed**: Progress files couldn't save on Windows due to path separator mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded forward slash `/` separator didn't work with Windows backslash `\` paths
- **Solution Implemented**:
  ```typescript
  private static getProgressFilePath(flashcardSetFilePath: string): string {
    const pathParts = flashcardSetFilePath.split(/[/\\]/);  // Split on both separators
    const filename = pathParts[pathParts.length - 1];
    const nameWithoutExt = filename.replace(/\.json$/, '');

    // Detect the path separator used in the original path
    const separator = flashcardSetFilePath.includes('\\') ? '\\' : '/';

    const directory = pathParts.slice(0, -1).join(separator);
    return `${directory}${separator}${nameWithoutExt}.progress.json`;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Extensive Debug Logging for Progress Saving
- **File Modified**: `src/services/ProgressService.ts` (lines 119-165)
- **Problem Addressed**: User couldn't determine why progress wasn't saving
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added comprehensive `console.log()` statements throughout `saveProgress()` method
  - Log sections: START/END markers, input parameters, API availability, save paths, operation status
  - Enables easy troubleshooting of save failures in production

- **Debug Output Example**:
  ```
  === SAVE PROGRESS START ===
  flashcardSetId: abc123
  flashcardSetName: Spanish Vocabulary
  flashcardSetFilePath: C:\Users\Ben\flashcards.json
  progress entries: 15
  tauriAPI available: true
  Saving to desktop path: C:\Users\Ben\flashcards.progress.json
  Desktop save completed successfully
  === SAVE PROGRESS END ===
  ```

#### 4. Async Progress Updates After Each Answer
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Study/StudySession.tsx` (lines 77-105)
- **Problem Addressed**: Progress only saved at session end, causing data loss on unexpected exits
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Changed `updateProgress()` from synchronous to `async` function
  - Added immediate `await ProgressService.saveProgress()` call after each answer
  - Maintains backup save at session end for redundancy
  - Proper error handling with `try-catch` blocks

- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  const updateProgress = async (arrowId: string, correct: boolean) => {
    if (!studySession.progressMap || !state.currentSet) return;

    const existingProgress = studySession.progressMap[arrowId];

    if (existingProgress) {
      const updatedProgress = SpacedRepetitionAlgorithm.calculateNextReview(
        existingProgress,
        correct,
        3  // Default difficulty
      );

      studySession.progressMap[arrowId] = updatedProgress;

      // Save progress immediately after each answer
      try {
        await ProgressService.saveProgress(
          state.currentSet.id,
          state.currentSet.name,
          studySession.progressMap,
          flashcardSetFilePath
        );
        console.log('Progress saved after answer:', arrowId, updatedProgress);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to save progress after answer:', error);
      }
    }
  };
  ```

#### 5. Ready Cards Counter Implementation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Study/StudyModeSelector.tsx` (lines 6, 10-11, 29-33, 103-107)
  - `src/components/Layout/MainLayout.tsx` (lines 29, 143-166, 378)
- **Problem Addressed**: No visual indication of how many cards are due for spaced repetition review
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `readyCardsCount` prop to `StudyModeSelector`
  - Load progress when flashcard set opens
  - Calculate count of arrows where `nextReview <= now`
  - Display pulsing purple badge on spaced repetition mode option
  - Badge only appears when count > 0

- **Visual Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // StudyModeSelector badge rendering
  {mode === 'spaced-repetition' && readyCardsCount > 0 && (
    <span className="ready-badge">{readyCardsCount}</span>
  )}
  ```

- **CSS for Badge**:
  ```css
  .ready-badge {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;
    font-size: 0.85rem;
    font-weight: 600;
    animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
  }
  ```

#### 6. Custom Path Mode Complete Redesign
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Study/StudySession.tsx` (lines 26-27, 39-49, 185-203, 216-291)
  - `src/App.css` (added 350+ lines of custom path CSS)
- **Problem Addressed**: Original custom path design was confusing and didn't provide intuitive network navigation
- **Revolutionary Solution Implemented**: Interactive network browser with radial arrow layout

##### 6.1 Interactive Network Browser Concept
- **Central Side Display**: Large purple circle (200px diameter) showing current side's value
- **Radial Arrow Layout**: All arrows positioned in a circle around center (250px radius)
- **Two-Direction Navigation**:
  - Green outgoing arrows (current side → other sides)
  - Yellow incoming arrows (other sides → current side)
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click any arrow button to navigate to connected side

##### 6.2 Technical Implementation Details

**Starting Point Selection**:
```typescript
// Initialize to most connected side
useEffect(() => {
  if (studySession.mode === 'custom-path' && state.currentSet && currentQuestion) {
    const flashcard = state.currentSet.flashcards.find(f => f.id === currentQuestion.flashcardId);
    if (flashcard && !customPathCurrentSideId) {
      const startingSideId = StudyModeGenerator.findMostConnectedSide(flashcard);
      setCustomPathCurrentSideId(startingSideId);
    }
  }
}, [studySession.mode, state.currentSet, currentQuestion, customPathCurrentSideId]);
```

**Radial Positioning with Trigonometry**:
```typescript
// Calculate arrow positions around center
const allArrows = [
  ...outgoingArrows.map(a => ({ ...a, isOutgoing: true })),
  ...incomingArrows.map(a => ({ ...a, isOutgoing: false }))
];
const angleStep = (2 * Math.PI) / Math.max(allArrows.length, 1);

// Position each arrow node
const angle = index * angleStep - Math.PI / 2;  // Start from top
const radius = 250;
const x = Math.cos(angle) * radius;
const y = Math.sin(angle) * radius;

<div className="arrow-node" style={{ transform: `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)` }}>
  {/* Arrow button */}
</div>
```

**Arrow Button Simplification**:
- **Before**: Showed both arrow label and destination side value
- **After**: Only shows arrow label with directional icon
- **Format**: `← arrow_label` (incoming) or `arrow_label →` (outgoing)

##### 6.3 Simplified Custom Path Header
- **Problem**: Original header showed question counter and stats inappropriate for exploration mode
- **Solution**: Removed all header content except "Network Explorer" title and "End Session" button
- **Rationale**: Custom path is exploratory, not quiz-based, so progress tracking isn't relevant

##### 6.4 Collision Prevention Fix
- **Problem**: "End Session" banner overlayed top arrow buttons, making them unclickable
- **Solution**: Added `padding-top: 3rem` to `.custom-path-browser` and `margin-top: 2rem` to `.network-container`
- **Result**: Clear separation between header and interactive elements

#### 7. Progress Loading at Study Setup
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Study/StudySetup.tsx` (lines 72-91)
- **Problem Addressed**: Spaced repetition needed to access existing progress before starting session
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Load progress using `ProgressService.loadProgress()` when spaced repetition mode selected
  - Initialize new progress entries for arrows not yet studied
  - Reuse existing progress for previously studied arrows
  - Pass complete `progressMap` to study session for tracking

#### 8. Study Session Props Enhancement
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/Study/StudySession.tsx` (lines 7-10)
  - `src/components/Layout/MainLayout.tsx` (lines 352, 356)
- **Problem Addressed**: Progress service needed file path to save desktop progress files
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `flashcardSetFilePath?: string` prop to `StudySession`
  - Passed through from `MainLayout` where file path is tracked
  - Enables proper `.progress.json` file naming based on flashcard file name

### User Experience Improvements

#### 1. Spaced Repetition Workflow
- **Before**: No visual indication of due cards, progress lost between sessions
- **After**:
  - Purple badge shows exact count of cards due for review
  - Progress persists across sessions
  - Cards scheduled based on performance
  - Confidence grows as mastered cards appear less frequently

#### 2. Custom Path Mode Transformation
- **Before**: Linear list-based navigation, unclear about network structure
- **After**:
  - Visual representation of network topology
  - Central focus on current concept
  - Clear indication of navigation options
  - Color-coded directionality (green outgoing, yellow incoming)
  - Intuitive click-to-explore interaction

#### 3. Progress Reliability
- **Before**: Progress only saved at session end (risk of data loss)
- **After**:
  - Saves after each answer
  - Survives unexpected exits
  - Desktop: persistent `.progress.json` files
  - Web: localStorage with flashcard set ID

## Session 9 Follow-up: Tauri File System Permissions Fix (October 15, 2025)

### Overview
Resolved critical Tauri v2 security error preventing progress files from being saved. The error "forbidden path" was caused by Tauri's default file system permissions blocking write access to arbitrary file paths.

### Problem Identified
- **Error Message**: `Error saving progress: forbidden path: C:\Users\Ben\Desktop\Coding\Visual Studio Code\Personal_Projects\Extended-Flashcards\MyFlashcards\complex.progress.json`
- **Root Cause**: Tauri v2's file system plugin requires explicit permission scopes for file operations
- **Impact**: Progress files could not be saved despite correct implementation of ProgressService

### Solution Implemented

#### File Modified: `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`

**Before (Insufficient Permissions)**:
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "dialog:default",
    "fs:default",
    "fs:allow-read-text-file",
    "fs:allow-write-text-file",
    "fs:allow-read-dir",
    "fs:allow-exists"
  ]
}
```

**After (Scoped Permissions with Wildcard)**:
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "dialog:default",
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-read-text-file",
      "allow": [{ "path": "**" }]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-write-text-file",
      "allow": [{ "path": "**" }]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-exists",
      "allow": [{ "path": "**" }]
    },
    "fs:allow-read-dir"
  ],
  "platforms": [
    "linux",
    "macOS",
    "windows"
  ]
}
```

### Technical Explanation

#### Tauri v2 Security Model
- **Default Behavior**: Blocks all file system access except explicitly allowed paths
- **Purpose**: Protects users from malicious applications accessing sensitive files
- **Scope Requirements**: Each file operation permission requires a scope specifying allowed paths

#### Wildcard Pattern Solution
- **Pattern**: `**` (glob wildcard matching all paths)
- **Effect**: Allows application to read/write files anywhere the user has OS-level permissions
- **Justification**:
  - Users explicitly select flashcard files through file dialogs
  - Progress files must be saved in same directory as user-selected flashcard files
  - Application only accesses flashcard and progress files, not sensitive system files

#### Security Considerations
- **Safe for Desktop Application**: Locally-run app with user-controlled file access
- **No Data Exfiltration**: No network access to file contents
- **User Intent**: All file operations initiated by user actions (open, save, study)
- **OS Permissions**: Still respects operating system file permissions

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/capabilities/
└── default.json         # Added scoped file system permissions
```

### Testing and Validation

#### Before Fix
- ❌ Error: "forbidden path" when saving progress
- ❌ `.progress.json` files not created
- ❌ Spaced repetition progress lost between sessions

#### After Fix
- ✅ Progress files save successfully
- ✅ `.progress.json` files created in flashcard directories
- ✅ Spaced repetition progress persists correctly
- ✅ No security warnings or errors

### Development Process
1. **Error Discovery**: User reported "forbidden path" error in console
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified Tauri v2 security restrictions
3. **Solution Research**: Reviewed Tauri v2 capabilities documentation
4. **Implementation**: Added scoped permissions with wildcard pattern
5. **Testing**: Restarted Tauri dev server to apply new permissions
6. **Validation**: Confirmed progress files now save successfully

### Tauri v2 Best Practices Learned

#### Capability Scopes
- Always specify scopes for file system operations
- Use wildcards judiciously based on application requirements
- Document security justification for broad permissions

#### Permission Patterns
- `{ "path": "**" }`: All paths (use for user-controlled file access)
- `{ "path": "$APPDATA/**" }`: App data directory only
- `{ "path": "$HOME/Documents/**" }`: Specific user directories

#### Development Workflow
- Changes to `capabilities/*.json` require application restart
- Test file operations in development mode before building
- Validate permissions work across all target platforms

### Phase 3 Final Status

With this fix, Phase 3 is now **100% complete** and fully functional:

#### ✅ All Study Modes Working
- Self-test with fuzzy matching
- Multiple choice with intelligent distractors
- Flash mode with click-to-reveal
- Spaced repetition with SM-2 algorithm
- Custom path as interactive network browser

#### ✅ Progress Persistence Fully Functional
- Desktop: `.progress.json` files save alongside flashcard sets
- Web: localStorage persistence
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Immediate saving after each answer
- Session-end backup saving

#### ✅ Complete User Experience
- Ready cards counter with pulsing badge
- Custom path radial network browser
- Professional visual design
- Intuitive workflows
- Reliable data persistence

### Conclusion

The Tauri file system permissions fix was the final piece needed to complete Phase 3. The issue was not with the ProgressService implementation, but with Tauri's security model requiring explicit permission scopes. With the wildcard scope now configured, the Extended Flashcards application provides a complete, production-ready study system with reliable progress tracking across all platforms.

**Phase 3 Complete**: All study modes functional, progress persistence working perfectly, ready for Phase 4 development.

## Session 10: Phase 3 Code Cleanup & Housekeeping (October 16, 2025)

### Overview
Performed comprehensive code cleanup to remove redundant debug logging, update deprecated comments, and eliminate unused CSS from Phase 3 development. This housekeeping session ensures clean, maintainable code as Phase 3 concludes and prepares the foundation for Phase 4 development.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Algorithm Comment Updates
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/algorithms/studyModes.ts`
  - `src/algorithms/spacedRepetition.ts`
- **Problem Addressed**: Outdated header comments indicated "Complete but not yet integrated"
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated `studyModes.ts` header to: `// Phase 3: Study Mode Generator`
  - Updated `spacedRepetition.ts` header to: `// Phase 3: Spaced Repetition Algorithm`
  - Removed "Complete but not yet integrated" suffix from both files
- **Rationale**: Phase 3 is now fully integrated, comments should reflect current implementation status

#### 2. Progress Service Debug Logging Cleanup
- **File Modified**: `src/services/ProgressService.ts` (lines 126-160)
- **Problem Addressed**: Excessive debug logging added during troubleshooting Windows path separator issues
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed 13 console.log statements from `saveProgress()` method
  - Removed verbose debugging sections:
    - `=== SAVE PROGRESS START ===` banner
    - Parameter logging (flashcardSetId, flashcardSetName, flashcardSetFilePath)
    - Progress entries count logging
    - API availability logging
    - Desktop path logging
    - Save completion logging
    - `=== SAVE PROGRESS END ===` banner
  - Kept essential error handling: `console.error('Error saving progress:', error)`
- **Impact**: Reduced noise in production logs while maintaining critical error reporting

#### 3. Study Session Debug Logging Cleanup
- **File Modified**: `src/components/Study/StudySession.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Line 100**: Removed `console.log('Progress saved after answer:', arrowId, updatedProgress)`
  - **Lines 127-131**: Removed session statistics logging from `handleEndSession()`
  - Removed verbose session completion logging including:
    - Duration calculation and logging
    - Accuracy calculation and logging
    - Session stats logging
- **Kept Essential Functionality**:
  - Error handling: `console.error('Failed to save progress after answer:', error)`
  - Progress saving logic fully intact
- **Rationale**: Debug logging served its purpose during development, now produces unnecessary console noise

#### 4. Deprecated CSS Removal
- **File Modified**: `src/App.css`
- **Problem Addressed**: Arrow label dialog CSS no longer needed after Phase 1 switch to inline editing
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed entire "Arrow Label Overlay" section (~60 lines)
  - Removed classes:
    - `.arrow-label-overlay` (modal overlay)
    - `.arrow-label-dialog` (dialog container)
    - `.arrow-label-dialog h3` (dialog header)
    - `.arrow-label-dialog input` (text input)
    - `.arrow-label-dialog input:focus` (input focus state)
    - `.arrow-label-buttons` (button container)
    - `.arrow-label-buttons button` (button styles)
    - `.arrow-label-buttons button:hover` (button hover state)
- **Context**: Arrow label editing now uses inline text input directly on canvas (implemented in Phase 1, Session 3)

### Code Quality Improvements

#### Debug Logging Strategy
- **Before Cleanup**: 13+ debug console.log statements throughout Phase 3 code
- **After Cleanup**:
  - Essential error logging preserved: `console.error()` for failures
  - Warning messages preserved: `console.warn()` for validation issues
  - Debug statements removed: verbose progress tracking eliminated
  - Commented debug lines kept: Lines prefixed with `// Debug:` preserved for future development

#### CSS Organization
- **Before**: 60 lines of unused dialog CSS mixed with active styles
- **After**: Clean separation of functional CSS, deprecated patterns removed
- **Benefit**: Reduced stylesheet size, improved maintainability

#### Comment Accuracy
- **Before**: Comments indicating code "not yet integrated"
- **After**: Comments accurately reflect Phase 3 completion status
- **Benefit**: Clear understanding of implementation state for future developers
